<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This granular model is based on the general description of granular
force interaction as described in <A HREF = "pair_gran.html">pair gran</A>.
</P>
<P>The spring part of the tangential force (k_t) is a "history" effect 
that accounts for the tangential displacement ("tangential overlap") 
between the particles for the duration of the time they are in contact.
</P>
<P>If this model is chose, then this "tangential overlap" spring force is
actually calculated / taken into account.
</P>
<P>The coefficient of friction cof is the upper limit of the tangential force through 
the Coulomb criterion Ft = cof*Fn, where Ft and Fn are the tangential spring and normal 
force components in the formulas above.
