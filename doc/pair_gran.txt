[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This LIGGGHTS command offers the following improvements vs. LAMMPS: The stiffness and damping coefficients k_n, k_t, gamma_n, gamma_t are now derived from the material properties. Also, a new model for macroscopic cohesion is introduced.

[General description:]

The {gran} styles use the following formula for the frictional force between two granular particles, when the distance r between two particles of radii Ri and Rj is less than their contact distance d = Ri + Rj. There is no force between the particles when r > d: 

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_html_60b8ced2.png)

In the first term is the normal force between the two particles and the second term is the 
tangential force. The normal force has 2 terms, a contact force and a damping force. The 
tangential force also has 2 terms: a shear force and a damping force. The shear force is 
a "history" effect that accounts for the tangential displacement ("tangential overlap") 
between the particles for the duration of the time they are in contact. This term is 
included in pair styles {hooke/history} and {hertz/history}, but is not included in 
pair style {hooke}. Keyword {tangential_damping} can be used to eliminate the second
part of the force in tangential direction. Additional keywords control model settings such as 
{rolling_friction} and {cohesion}.

The quantities in the equations are as follows:

delta_n = d - r = overlap distance of 2 particles  :ulb,l
k_n = elastic constant for normal contact :l
k_t = elastic constant for tangential contact :l
gamma_n = viscoelastic damping constant for normal contact :l
gamma_t = viscoelastic damping constant for tangential contact :l
delta_t = tangential displacement vector between 2 spherical particles which is truncated to satisfy a frictional yield criterion :l
rmu = coefficient of rolling friction :l
contactradius = contact radius, equal to particle radius - 0.5 * delta_n :l
v_n = normal component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles :l
v_t = tangential component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles :l
w_r = relative rotational velocity of the 2 particles :l
:ule

[Hertz/history:]

For hertz/history, the Kn, Kt, gamma_n, and gamma_t coefficients are calculated as follows from the material properties:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_html_m5aad056c.png)

[Hooke and hooke/history:]

For hooke and hooke/history, the k_n, k_t, gamma_n, and gamma_t coefficients are calculated as follows from the material properties:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_html_147eaf38.png)

Therby, the following definitions apply to two particles in contact:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_html_m225ba7de.png)

To define those material properties, it is mandatory to use multiple "fix property/global"_fix_property.html commands:

fix id all property/global youngsModulus peratomtype value_1 value_2 ...
    (value_i=value for Youngs Modulus of atom type i)
fix id all property/global poissonsRatio peratomtype value_1 value_2 ...
    (value_i=value for Poisson ratio of atom type i)
fix id all property/global coefficientRestitution peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the coefficient of restitution between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation)
fix id all property/global coefficientFriction peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the (static) coefficient of friction between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre

The "characteristic impact velocity" is only used for hooke styles: 

fix id all property/global characteristicVelocity scalar value
    (value=value for characteristic impact velocity) :pre

[Hertz/history/stiffness and hooke/history/stiffness:]

For hooke/history/stiffness with {absolute_damping} = 'off' (which is default), the 
specified damping coefficient is multiplied by the effective mass. The forces are implemented as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_html_m566a9984.png)

For hooke/history/stiffness with {absolute_damping} = 'on', this multiplication is omitted
and the forces become

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_html_m76cd8bd9.png)

For hertz/history/stiffness, the force implementation as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_html_m4dff7906.png)

The k_n_specified, k_t_specified, gamma_n_specified, and gamma_t_specified coefficients are 
given by the user as follows from the material properties:

fix id all property/global kn peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for k_n between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation)
fix id all property/global kt peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for k_t between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation)
fix id all property/global gamman peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for gamma_n between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation)
fix id all property/global gammat peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for gamma_t between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre

For the hooke model, if the absolute damping implementation is used ({absolute_damping} = 'on'), 
the damping coefficients must be named gamman_abs and gammat_abs instead of gamman, 
gammat as follows:

fix id all property/global gamman_abs peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for gamma_n between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation)
fix id all property/global gammat_abs peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for gamma_t between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre

General comments, cohesion model, rolling friction model :h3

IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to use atom styles beginning from 1, e.g. 1,2,3,...

For all pair styles, the coefficient of friction cof is the upper limit of the tangential force through 
the Coulomb criterion Ft = cof *Fn, where Ft and Fn are the total tangential and normal force components 
in the formulas above. Thus in the Hookean case, the tangential force between 2 particles grows according 
to a tangential spring and dash-pot model until Ft/Fn = cof and is then held at Ft = Fn*cof until the 
particles lose contact. In the Hertzian case, a similar analogy holds, though the spring is no longer linear.

The optional [rolling friction model] (a constant directional torque model, see Ai et al) is activated via
{rolling_friction} = 'cdt', and adds an additional torque contribution, equal to

torque_rf = rmu*k_n*delta_n*w_r_shear/mag(w_r_shear)*(R*).

w_r_shear is the projection of w_r into the shear plane, where w_r = w1-w2

If the rolling friction model is activated, the coefficient of rolling friction (rmu) must be defined as

fix id all property/global coefficientRollingFriction peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the coefficient of rolling friction between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre


A simple linear [cohesion model] can be activated by setting {cohesion} = 'sjkr' 
(simplified Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model). If two particle are in contact, 
it adds an additional normal force tending to maintain the contact, which writes 

F = k A, 

where A is the particle contact area and k is the cohesion energy density in J/m3. If you are 
using the linear cohesion model, you must also define the cohesion energy density:

fix id all property/global cohesionEnergyDensity peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the cohesion energy density (in Energy/Length3 units) between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre

IMPORTANT NOTE: The cohesion model has been derived for the Hertzian Style, it may note be 
appropriate for the Hookean styles.

For granular styles there are no additional coefficients to set for each pair of atom types 
via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command. All settings are global and are made via the 
pair_style command. However you must still use the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html for all pairs 
of granular atom types. For example the command

pair_coeff * * :pre

should be used if all atoms in the simulation interact via a granular potential 
(i.e. one of the pair styles above is used). If a granular potential is used as a sub-style 
of "pair_style hybrid"_pair_hybrid.html, then specific atom types can be used in the pair_coeff 
command to determine which atoms interact via a granular potential. 


[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info:]

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html mix, shift, table, and tail options are not 
relevant for granular pair styles.

These pair styles write their information to "binary restart files"_restart.html, 
so a pair_style command does not need to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The material properties are not written to restart files! Thus, if you 
restart a simulation, you have to re-define them (by using the fixes mentioned above).

These pair styles can only be used via the pair keyword of the "run_style respa"_run_style.html 
command. They do not support the inner, middle, outer keywords. 

[Restrictions:]

These pair styles require that atoms store torque and angular velocity (omega) as defined by the "atom_style"_atom_style.html. They also require a per-particle radius is stored. The {granular} atom style does all of this.

This pair style requires you to use the "communicate vel yes"_communicate.html option so that velocites are stored by ghost atoms.

Only unit system that are self-consistent (si, cgs, lj) can be used with this pair style.

{rolling_friction} = 'off'
{cohesion} = 'off'
{tangential_damping} = 'on'
