fix particledistribution/discrete command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID particledistribution/discrete seed ntemp t_id t_m ...  :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
particledistribution/discrete = style name of this fix command  :l
seed = random number generator seed (integer value) :l
ntemp = number of particle templates to be used in this command :l
zero or more {t_id}/{t_m} pairs are appended, number of pairs must match ntemp :l
{t_id} = id of a fix of type particletemplate/sphere
{t_m} = mass % for this template in the distribution :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix pdd1 all particledistribution/discrete 6778  1 pts1 1.0
fix pdd1 all particledistribution/discrete 1239  2 pts1 0.3 pts2 0.7  :pre

[Description:]

Define a discrete particle distribution that defines a discrete particle distribution to be inserted by the "fix_pour_dev"_fix_pour_dev.html command. It takes several templates of type "fix_particletemplate_sphere"_fix_particletemplate_sphere.html as inputs, which define the properties of the single particles that are part of the distribution.

At insertion, particles are chosen according to the mass-% distribution as defined by each pair (t_id, t_m). Note that the sum of all weights t_m must be equal to 1.0, if this is not the case the user is warned at the distribution is normalized. Note that large particles are inserted first, so that a higher volume fraction can be achieved. If not all desired insertions could be performed, it is likely that the distribution is not accurately reproduced.

IMPORTANT NOTE: As opposed to the number-based distributions used by "fix_pour"_fix_pour.html and "fix_pour_legacy"_fix_pour_legacy.html, this fix uses the more common distribution based on mass-% as input (as does "fix_particletemplate_sphere"_).

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Information about the random state in this fix is written to "binary restart files"_restart.html so you can restart a simulation with the same particles being chosen for insertion. None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are relevant to this fix. No global scalar or vector or per-atom quantities are stored by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15. No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start}/{stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command. This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.
