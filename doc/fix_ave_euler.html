<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Calculate cell-based averages of velocity, radius, volume fraction, 
and pressure (-1/3 * trace of the stress tensor) every few timesteps,
as specified by the <I>nevery</I> keyword. The size of the cells is calculated
as multiple of the maximum cutoff, via the <I>cell_size_relative</I>.
Note that at least a relative cell size of 3 is required.
</P>
<P>Note that velocity is favre (mass) averaged, whereas radius is arithmetically
averaged. To calculate the stress, this command internally uses a 
<A HREF = "compute_stress_atom.html">compute stress/atom</A> . It includes the convective 
term correctly for granular particles with non-zero average velocity 
(which is not included  in <A HREF = "compute_stress_atom.html">compute stress/atom</A>).
However, it does not include bond, angle, diahedral or kspace contributions 
so that the stress tensor finally reads
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/stress_tensor_granular.png">

<P>where vave is the (cell-based) average velocity. 
The first term is a kinetic energy contribution for atom <I>I</I>.  The
second term is a pairwise energy contribution where <I>n</I> loops over the
<I>Np</I> neighbors of atom <I>I</I>, <I>r1</I> and <I>r2</I> are the positions of the 2
atoms in the pairwise interaction, and <I>F1</I> and <I>F2</I> are the forces on
the 2 atoms resulting from the pairwise interaction.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>This fix computes the above-mentioned quantities for output via a 
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump euler/vtk</A> command.  The values can
only be accessed on timesteps that are multiples of <I>nevery</I> since that
is when calculations are performed. 
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Volume fractions and stresses are calculated based on the assumption
of a structured (equidistant regular) grid, so volume fractions and
stresses near walls that are not alligned with the grid will be
incorrect.
