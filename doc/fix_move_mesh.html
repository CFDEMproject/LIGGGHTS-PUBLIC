<P><B>LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:</B>
</P>
<P>This command is not available in LAMMPS.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform updates of position and velocity for mesh elements which are 
part of the <A HREF = "fix_mesh_surface.html">fix_mesh_surface</A> with ID <I>mesh-ID</I>
using the specified settings or formulas. The fix group is ignored
for this command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>linear</I> style moves mesh elements at a constant velocity, so that their
position <I>X</I> = (x,y,z) as a function of time is given in vector
notation as
</P>
<PRE>X(t) = X0 + V * delta 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>X0</I> = (x0,y0,z0) is their position at the time the fix is
specified, <I>V</I> is the specified velocity vector with components
(Vx,Vy,Vz), and <I>delta</I> is the time elapsed since the fix was
specified.  This style also sets the velocity of each atom to V =
(Vx,Vy,Vz). 
</P>
<P>The <I>linear/variable</I> style does the same as the <I>linear</I> style,
but uses three variables so that the velocity can be time-dependant.
</P>
<P>The <I>wiggle</I> style moves atoms in an oscillatory fashion, so that
their position <I>X</I> = (x,y,z) as a function of time is given in vector
notation as
</P>
<PRE>X(t) = X0 + A sin(omega*delta) 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>X0</I> = (x0,y0,z0) is their position at the time the fix is
specified, <I>A</I> is the specified amplitude vector with components
(Ax,Ay,Az), <I>omega</I> is 2 PI / <I>period</I>, and <I>delta</I> is the time
elapsed since the fix was specified.  This style also sets the
velocity of each element to the time derivative of this expression.
</P>
<P>The <I>rotate</I> style rotates around a rotation axis <I>R</I> =
(Rx,Ry,Rz) that goes thru a point <I>P</I> = (Px,Py,Pz).  The <I>period</I> of
the rotation is also specified.  This style also sets the velocity of
each element to (omega cross Rperp) where omega is its angular velocity
around the rotation axis and Rperp is a perpendicular vector from the
rotation axis to the atom. Note that the direction of rotation 
around the rotation axis is consistent with the right-hand rule: 
if your right-hand's thumb points along <I>R</I>, then your fingers 
wrap around the axis in the direction of rotation.
</P>
<P>The <I>rotate/variable</I> style does the same as the <I>rotate</I> style,
but uses a variable for the angular velocity so that the angular 
velocity can be time-dependant.
IMPORTANT NOTE: style <I>rotate</I> takes the period of the rotation
as input, <I>rotate/variable</I> takes angular velocity as input.
</P>
<P>The <I>riggle</I> style imposes an oscillatory rotation around a rotation
axis <I>R</I> = (Rx,Ry,Rz) that goes thru a point <I>P</I> = (Px,Py,Pz). 
The <I>period</I> of the oscillation is specified as well as the <I>amplitude</I>
in grad (Â°). This style also sets the velocity of
each element accordingly.
</P>
<P>The <I>viblin</I> style moves meshes in an oscillatory fashion with an vibration 
function of higher order, so that their position <I>X</I> = (x,y,z) as a function 
of time is given in vector notation as
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/viblin.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where <I>X0</I> = (x0,y0,z0) is their position at the time the fix is specified, 
<I>n</I> represents the order of the trigonometric series, <I>Cn</I> is the specified 
amplitude along the direction given by <I>axis</I> = (ax,ay,az). The vector <I>D</I>
is the unit vector of <I>axis</I>. The angular velocity omega is 2 PI / <I>period</I>, 
and <I>delta</I> is the time elapsed since the fix was specified. This style 
also sets the velocity of each element to the time derivative of this expression.
</P>
<P>The <I>vibrot</I> style generates an oscillatory rotation around a rotation <I>axis</I> = 
(ax,ay,az) that goes thru a point <I>origin</I> = (Px,Py,Pz). The <I>period</I> of the 
oscillation is used to calculate omega, the amplitudes <I>Cn</I> and the phase phase 
<I>n</I> are given in rad. The change of rotation angle per time <I>gamma(t)</I> is 
described by trigonometric series of order <I>n</I>. The formula for this change is
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/vibrot.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>This style also sets the velocity of each element accordingly
</P>
<P>NOTE: If a dangerous tri neighbor list build is detected, this may be due to 
the fact that the geometry is moved too close to a region where particle 
insertion is taking place so that initial interpenetration happens when 
the particles are inserted.
</P>
<P>NOTE: When moving a mesh element, not only the node positions are moved 
but also a couple of other vectors. So moving one mesh element is more
costly as one particle.
</P>
<P><B>Superposition of multiple fix move/mesh commands:</B>
</P>
<P>It is possible to superpose multiple fix move/mesh commands. In this
case, the reference frame for the second move command moves along as
the mesh is moved by the first move command etc. E.g. for style <I>rotate</I>, 
the origin of the rotation axis would be in local reference frame.
</P>
<P>Example: A mesh should rotate around a central axis and additionally 
revolve around its center of mass. The first move command should be
the rotation around the central axis, the second move command the 
revolution around the center of mass of the mesh.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix writes the original coordinates of moving elements to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary
restart files</A>, so that the motion can be continuous in a
restarted simulation.  See the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
command for info on how to re-specify a fix in an input script that
reads a restart file, so that the operation of the fix continues in an
uninterrupted fashion.
</P>
<P>None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options are relevant to this
fix.  
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> 
</P>
<P>If multiple fix move/mesh movements are superposed onto one mesh, 
they have to be deleted in reverse order of their creation
Mesh elements may not be deleted in case due to leaving the simulation box for a fixed boundary. 
In this case, an error is generated. See <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> command for details.
