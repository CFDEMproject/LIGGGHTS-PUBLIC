fix mesh/surface/stress/servo command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID mesh/surface/stress/servo file filename premesh_keywords premesh_values mesh_keywords mesh_values surface_keyword surface_values stress_keywords stress_values servo_keywords servo_values :pre

ID, is documented in "fix"_fix.html command, the group-ID is ignored for this command. :ulb,l
mesh/surface/stress/servo = style name of this fix command  :l
file filename premesh_keywords premesh_values mesh_keywords mesh_values surface_keyword surface_values stress_keywords stress_values are documented in "fix mesh/surface/stress"_fix_mesh_surface_stress.html. :l
zero or more servo_keyword/value pairs may be appended 
servo keywords = {com} (obligatory) or {dim} (obligatory) or {ctrlPV} (obligatory) or {vel_max} (obligatory) or {kp} or {ki} or {kd} :l
{com} values = x, y, z
    x, y, z = coordinates of the center of mass of the body (distance units)
{dim} value = x or y or z
    x, y, z = dimension in which to apply servo wall 
{ctrlPV} values = force or torque
    force = use force as controll process value, i.e. control force
    torque = use torque as controll process value, i.e. control torque
{target_val} values = val
    val = target value for the controller (force units or torque units, depending on {ctrlPV})
{vel_max} values = v
    v = maximum velocity magnitude for servo wall (velocity units)
{kp} values = k
    k = proportional constant for PID controller 
{ki} values = k
    k = integral constant for PID controller
{kd} values = k
    k = differential constant for PID controller :pre

[Examples:]

fix servo all mesh/surface/stress/servo file plate.stl type 1 com 0. 0. 0. ctrlPV force dim z  target_val 10 vel_max 1.

[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This command is not available in LAMMPS.

[Description:]

This fix implements the functionality of "fix mesh/surface/stress"_fix_mesh_surface_stress.html but 
it additionally assumes the mesh being a servo wall that compacts a particle packing until either a 
total force (for {ctrlPV} = force)  or a total torque (for {ctrlPV} = torque) is acting on the mesh.
The target value is defined via keyword {target_val}. The servo can act in any dimension 
(as specified by the {dim} keyword), but only in one dimension at a time. 
A negative value for {target_val} leads to a wall motion towards negative {dim}-direction and vice versa. The user has to specify 
the center of mass (keyword {com}) and the maximum velocity allowed for the servo wall by keyword {vel_max}.
Note that {vel_max} < "skin"_neighbor.html /(2* "timestep"_timestep.html ) is required.

The controller itself is a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller which is controlled by
3 constants kp, ki, kd:

output = kp * error + ki * errorsum + kd * errorchange

where 'error' is the current devation of the controll process value to the target value, 
'errorsum' is the time integration (sum) of the error values and 'errorchange' its derivative. The controller
also includes an "anti-wind-up scheme" which prohibits accumulation of erroneous controller output caused 
by the integral part due to unavoidable long-lasting deviations.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

This fix stores a global vector with 9 components for access by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15. 
The first 3 components are equal to the total force on the mesh, the next 3 components store the total torque 
on the mesh. The last 3 components output the wall position.
Furthermore, this fix writes the state of the servo wall to binary restart files so 
that a simulation can continue correctly.
This fix supports "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html with option {integrate} = 'start' or 'stop'
to start or stop the servo wall integration inbetween two runs.
This fix also supports "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html with option {target_val} = val to
change the target value inbetween two runs.
This fix also supports "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html with option {ctrlParam} = kp ki kd
to change the controller params inbetween two runs.

[Restrictions:]

When using this fix, along with scaling or rotate the body, all the servo_keyword/value pairs have to represent
the state after scaling/rotation.
Mesh elements may not be deleted in case due to leaving the simulation box for a fixed boundary. 
In this case, an error is generated. See "boundary"_boundary.html command for details.
