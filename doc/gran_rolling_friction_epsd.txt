gran rolling_friction epsd model :h3

[Syntax:]

rolling_friction epsd \[other model_type/model_name pairs as described "here"_pair_gran.html \] keyword values :pre
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to the end (after all models are specified) :l
  {torsionTorque} values = 'on' or 'off'
    on = also the normal, relative rotation (torsion) contributes to the resulting torque
    off = only the tangential, relative rotation contributes to the resulting torque :pre

[Description:]

This model can be used as part of "pair gran"_pair_gran.html and
"fix wall/gran"_fix_wall_gran.html

The elastic-plastic spring-dashpot (EPSD) model (see Ai et al.) adds an additional
torque contribution, equal to

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_hooke_eqEpsd1.gif)

where the torque due to the spring M_rk is calculated as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_hooke_eqEpsd2.gif)

Here k_r denotes the rolling stiffness that depends on the stiffness of the normal spring (from the normal contact law), the effective radius and the coefficient of rolling friction (mu_r). Following [(Ai)] the prefactor of 2.25 is valid for 3D simulations. The "EPSD3 model"_gran_rolling_friction_epsd3.html allows to modify the prefactor. dtheta_r is the incremental relative
rotation between the particles. The spring torque is limited by the full mobilisation
torque M_rm that is determined by the normal force F_n and the coefficient of rolling
friction (mu_r) (compare the "CDT model"_gran_rolling_friction_cdt.html).

The viscous damping torque M_rd is implemented as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_hooke_eqEpsd3.gif)

where in the current implementation the damping is disabled in case of full mobilisation
(f = 0). The damping coefficient C_r may be expressed as:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gran_hooke_eqEpsd4.gif)

Here I_i/j is the moment of inertia and m_i/j is the mass of the particles i and j,
respectively.

The coefficient of rolling friction (mu_r) must be defined as

fix id all property/global coefficientRollingFriction peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the coefficient of rolling friction between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre

This coefficient mu_r is equal to the mu_r as defined in the "CDT model"_gran_rolling_friction_cdt.html.
In addition to mu_r, eta_r is the required material property that must be defined as

fix id all property/global coefficientRollingViscousDamping peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the coefficient of rolling friction between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre

IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to use atom styles beginning from 1, e.g. 1,2,3,...

[Torque information:]

By default the relative, normal rotation (torsion) is subtracted and does not contribute to the resulting torque. By setting the {torsionTorque} keyword to 'on', the full relative rotation contributes to the rolling friciton torque.

[Coarse-graining information:]

Using "coarsegraining"_coarsegraining.html in
combination with this command might lead to
different dynamics or system state and thus to 
inconsistencies.

NOTE: "Coarsegraining"_coarsegraining.html may or 
may not be available in LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC.

[Default:]

{torsionTorque} = 'off'
