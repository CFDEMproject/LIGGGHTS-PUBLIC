[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This command has been improved in accordance with the overhauled
"pair gran"_pair_gran.html styles. Furthermore, it offers the new
{wallstyle mesh}, which enables fix wall/gran to handle complex
wall geometries imported from CAD.

[Description:]

Bound the simulation domain of a granular system with a frictional wall.
All particles in the group interact with the wall when they are close enough
to touch it. The equation for the force between the wall and particles
touching it is the same as the corresponding equation on the
"pair_style granular"_pair_gran.html doc page, in the limit of one of the
 two particles going to infinite radius and mass (flat wall).

You must choose the {wallstyle} matching the pair style used, otherwise
an error is created (e.g.: "pair gran/hertz/history is incompatible with
fix wall/gran/hooke"). As with "pair_style granular"_pair_gran.html, you have
to define the mechanical properties for each material you are used in the
simulation with fix property commands. See "pair_style gran"_pair_gran.html
 for more details. Also, for style hooke/history simple the wall implementation 
uses absolute damping if keyword {absolute_damping} is set to 'on' in 
"pair_style gran"_pair_gran.html.

For wallstyle {mesh}, fix_id1, fix_id2 etc. must be IDs of valid fixes of 
type "fix mesh/surface"_fix_mesh_surface.html, defining the granular mesh 
to be used for the wall. Triangle-particle neighbor lists are built to efficiently 
track particle-triangle contacts. Particle-tri neighbor list build is triggered 
if any particle moves more than half the skin distance or (in case of moving mesh) if the mesh
itself moves more than half the skin distance since the last build. A warning
is generated if a dangerous particle-tri neigh list build is detected
(e.g. if particles are inserted too close to a wall, see section 'Restrictions').
For style {mesh}, the atom_type (material type) is inherited from the atom style provided
in the "fix mesh/surface"_fix_mesh_surface.html command. 

For {wallstyle primitive}, the atom_type (material type) has to be provided via
keyword {type}. Primitve walls can be {xplane} or {yplane} or {zplane} or {cylindrical}
or {conical}. The 3 planar options specify a pair of walls in a dimension.
Wall positions are given by values for lo and hi. Either of the values
can be specified as NULL if a single wall is desired. For a {zcylinder}
wallstyle, the cylinder's axis is at x = y = 0.0, and the radius of the
cylinder is specified. Likewise, a {zcone} wallstyle can be used, with
the axis at x = y = 0.0, and the hi and lo radii being specified.

:line

Optionally, planar or cylindrical or conical walls can be moving, if
the wiggle or shear keywords are appended. Both keywords cannot be used together.

For the {wiggle} keyword, the wall oscillates sinusoidally, similar to the
oscillations of frozen particles specified by the "fix wiggle"_fix_wiggle.html
command. This is useful in packing simulations of granular particles. The
arguments to the {wiggle} keyword specify a dimension for the motion, as
well as it's amplitude and period. Note that if the dimension is in the
plane of the wall, this is effectively a shearing motion. If the dimension
is perpendicular to the wall, it is more of a shaking motion.
A {zcylinder} or {zcone} wall can only be wiggled in the z dimension.

Each timestep, the position of a wiggled wall in the appropriate dim is set according to this equation:

position = coord + A - A cos (omega * delta) :pre

where {coord} is the specified initial position of the wall, {A} is the
amplitude, {omega} is 2 PI / period, and {delta} is the time elapsed since
the fix was specified. The velocity of the wall is set to the derivative of
this expression.

For the {shear} keyword, the wall moves continuously in the specified dimension
with velocity vshear. The dimension must be tangential to walls with a planar
wallstyle, e.g. in the y or z directions for an {xplane} wall. For {zcylinder}
walls, a dimension of z means the cylinder is moving in the z-direction along
it's axis. A dimension of x or y means the cylinder is spinning around the
z-axis, either in the clockwise direction for vshear > 0 or counter-clockwise
for vshear < 0. In this case, vshear is the tangential velocity of the wall
at whatever radius has been defined.

NOTE: The keywords wiggle or shear can NOT be used for {wallstyle mesh}.
For a moving a granular wall with {wallstyle mesh}, use the more flexible
command "fix move/mesh"fix_move_mesh.html, or use the keywords {velocity}
or {angular_velocity} in "fix mesh/surface"_fix_mesh_surface.html.

The keyword {temperature} is used to assign a constant temperature to the wall.
This setting gets effective in conjunction with heat conduction via
"fix heat/gran"_fix_heat_gran.html. For {wallstyle mesh}, the value
for the temperature given in this command is ignored and the temperature
value is specified per mesh via "fix mesh/surface"_fix_mesh_surface.html.

By specifying {store_force} = 'yes', you can instruct the command to
store the wall force exerted on the particles in a
"fix property/atom"_fix_property.html with id force_(ID), where (ID)
is the id of the fix wall/gran command.

The effect of keyword {rolling_friction}, {cohesion}, {tangential_damping}
and {absolute_damping} is explanted in "pair gran"_pair_gran.html

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

If applicable, contact history is written to "binary restart files"_restart.html
so simulations can continue properly.
None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are relevant to this fix.
No global scalar or vector or are stored by this fix.
If {store_force} = 'yes' is specified, the per-atom wall force can be
accessed by the various output commands via f_force(ID)[1], f_force(ID)[2],
f_force(ID)[3]. (ID) is the id of the fix wall/gran command.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the start/stop keywords of the
"run"_run.html command. This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html .

[Restrictions:]

There can be only one fix wall/gran command with style {mesh}. Note that
this is not really a restriction because you can include multiple fixes
of type "fix mesh/surface"_fix_mesh_surface.html in the fix wall/gran command.

When using style style {mesh}, you have to use the style {bin} for
the "neighbor command"_neighbor.html.

Style {mesh} can not be used in conjunction with triclinic simulation boxes.

When using style {mesh}' in combination with a particle insertion
command, you always have to keep a minimum distance between the wall and the
insertion region that is equal to maximum particle radius + half the skin
defined in the "neighbor command"_neighbor.html. Otherwise, newly inserted
particles interpenetrate the walls before a triangle neighbor list is built
the first time.

The keywords wiggle or shear can NOT be used for style {mesh}.
For moving granular wall with style mesh, use "fix move/mesh"fix_move_mesh.html.

Any dimension (xyz) that has a planar granular wall must be non-periodic.
