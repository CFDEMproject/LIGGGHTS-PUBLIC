<P><B>LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:</B>
</P>
<P>Two new styles (<I>mesh/stl</I> and <I>mesh/vtk</I>) are available for dumping 
granular mesh geometry into STL files or VTK files. The former is used 
for dumping only the geometry, while the latter command is used to dump 
the mesh IDs, stress etc- calculated on a granular mesh using the 
<A HREF = "fix_mesh_surface_stress.html">fix mesh/surface/stress</A>  command.
Furthermore, style <I>decomposition/vtk</I> can be used to dump the current
parallel domain decomposition to a VTK file.
Style <I>euler/vtk</I> can be used to dump cell-based averages to a VTK file.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump a snapshot of atom quantities to one or more files every N
timesteps in one of several styles.  The <I>image</I> style is the
exception; it creates a JPG or PPM image file of the atom
configuration every N timesteps, as discussed on the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>Only information for atoms in the specified group is dumped.  The
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify thresh and region</A> commands can also
alter what atoms are included.  Not all styles support all these
options; see details below.
</P>
<P>As described below, the filename determines the kind of output (text
or binary or gzipped, one big file or one per timestep, one big file
or one per processor).
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Unless the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify sort</A> option
is invoked, the lines of atom information written to dump files
(typically one line per atom) will be in an indeterminate order for
each snapshot.  This is even true when running on a single processor,
if the <A HREF = "atom_modify.html">atom_modify sort</A> option is on, which it is
by default.  In this case atoms are re-ordered periodically during a
simulation, due to spatial sorting.  It is also true when running in
parallel, because data for a single snapshot is collected from
multiple processors.
</P>
<P>For the <I>atom</I>, <I>custom</I>, <I>cfg</I>, and <I>local</I> styles, sorting is off by
default.  For the <I>dcd</I>, <I>xtc</I>, and <I>xyz</I> styles, sorting by atom ID
is on by default.  See the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> doc page for
details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>style</I> keyword determines what atom quantities are written to the
file and in what format.  Settings made via the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command can also alter the format of
individual values and the file itself.
</P>
<P>The <I>atom</I>, <I>local</I>, and <I>custom</I> styles create files in a simple text
format that is self-explanatory when viewing a dump file.  Many of the
LAMMPS <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">post-processing tools</A>, including
<A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A>, work with
this format.  
</P>
<P>For post-processing purposes the <I>atom</I> and <I>custom</I> text files are
self-describing in the following sense.
</P>
<P>The dimensions of the simulation box are included in each snapshot.
For an orthogonal simulation box this information is is formatted as:
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: BOX BOUNDS xx yy zz
xlo xhi
ylo yhi
zlo zhi 
</PRE>
<P>where xlo,xhi are the maximum extents of the simulation box in the
x-dimension, and similarly for y and z.  The "xx yy zz" represent 6
characters that encode the style of boundary for each of the 6
simulation box boundaries (xlo,xhi and ylo,yhi and zlo,zhi).  Each of
the 6 characters is either p = periodic, f = fixed, s = shrink wrap,
or m = shrink wrapped with a minimum value.  See the
<A HREF = "doc/boundary.html">boundary</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>For triclinic simulation boxes (non-orthogonal), an orthogonal
bounding box which encloses the triclinic simulation box is output,
along with the 3 tilt factors (xy, xz, yz) of the triclinic box,
formatted as follows:
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: BOX BOUNDS xy xz yz xx yy zz 
xlo_bound xhi_bound xy
ylo_bound yhi_bound xz
zlo_bound zhi_bound yz 
</PRE>
<P>The presence of the text "xy xz yz" in the ITEM line indicates that
the 3 tilt factors will be included on each of the 3 following lines.
This bounding box is convenient for many visualization programs.  The
meaning of the 6 character flags for "xx yy zz" is the same as above.
</P>
<P>Note that the first two numbers on each line are now xlo_bound instead
of xlo, etc, since they repesent a bounding box.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_12">this
section</A> of the doc pages for a geometric
description of triclinic boxes, as defined by LAMMPS, simple formulas
for how the 6 bounding box extents (xlo_bound,xhi_bound,etc) are
calculated from the triclinic parameters, and how to transform those
parameters to and from other commonly used triclinic representations.
</P>
<P>The "ITEM: ATOMS" line in each snapshot lists column descriptors for
the per-atom lines that follow.  For example, the descriptors would be
"id type xs ys zs" for the default <I>atom</I> style, and would be the atom
attributes you specify in the dump command for the <I>custom</I> style.
</P>
<P>For style <I>atom</I>, atom coordinates are written to the file, along with
the atom ID and atom type.  By default, atom coords are written in a
scaled format (from 0 to 1).  I.e. an x value of 0.25 means the atom
is at a location 1/4 of the distance from xlo to xhi of the box
boundaries.  The format can be changed to unscaled coords via the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> settings.  Image flags can also be
added for each atom via dump_modify.
</P>
<P>For style <I>atom/vtk</I>, atom coordinates, velocity, rotational 
velocity, force, atom ID, atom radius and atom type are written to 
VTK files. Note that you have to link against VTK libraries to use
this functionality.
</P>
<P>For style <I>local</I>, local output generated by <A HREF = "compute.html">computes</A>
and <A HREF = "fix.html">fixes</A> is used to generate lines of output that is
written to the dump file.  This local data is typically calculated by
each processor based on the atoms it owns, but there may be zero or
more entities per atom, e.g. a list of bond distances.  An explanation
of the possible dump local attributes is given below.  Note that by
using input from the <A HREF = "compute_property_local.html">compute
property/local</A> command with dump local,
it is possible to generate information on bonds, angles, etc that can
be cut and pasted directly into a data file read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command.
</P>
<P>Style <I>cfg</I> has the same command syntax as style <I>custom</I> and writes
extended CFG format files, as used by the
<A HREF = "http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A">AtomEye</A> visualization
package.  Since the extended CFG format uses a single snapshot of the
system per file, a wildcard "*" must be included in the filename, as
discussed below.  The list of atom attributes for style <I>cfg</I> must
begin with either "id type xs ys zs" or "id type xsu ysu zsu" or 
since these quantities are needed to
write the CFG files in the appropriate format (though the "id" and
"type" fields do not appear explicitly in the file).  Any remaining
attributes will be stored as "auxiliary properties" in the CFG files.
Note that you will typically want to use the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify
element</A> command with CFG-formatted files, to
associate element names with atom types, so that AtomEye can render
atoms appropriately. When unwrapped coordinates <I>xsu</I>, <I>ysu</I>, and <I>zsu</I>
are requested, the nominal AtomEye periodic cell dimensions are expanded 
by a large factor UNWRAPEXPAND = 10.0, which ensures atoms that are 
displayed correctly for up to UNWRAPEXPAND/2 periodic boundary crossings 
in any direction. 
Beyond this, AtomEye will rewrap the unwrapped coordinates. 
The expansion causes the atoms to be drawn farther
away from the viewer, but it is easy to zoom the atoms closer, and
the interatomic distances are unaffected.   
</P>
<P>The <I>dcd</I> style writes DCD files, a standard atomic trajectory format
used by the CHARMM, NAMD, and XPlor molecular dynamics packages.  DCD
files are binary and thus may not be portable to different machines.
The number of atoms per snapshot cannot change with the <I>dcd</I> style.
The <I>unwrap</I> option of the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command
allows DCD coordinates to be written "unwrapped" by the image flags
for each atom.  Unwrapped means that if the atom has passed through
a periodic boundary one or more times, the value is printed for what
the coordinate would be if it had not been wrapped back into the
periodic box.  Note that these coordinates may thus be far outside
the box size stored with the snapshot.
</P>
<P>The <I>xtc</I> style writes XTC files, a compressed trajectory format used
by the GROMACS molecular dynamics package, and described
<A HREF = "http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/xtc.html">here</A>.
The precision used in XTC files can be adjusted via the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command.  The default value of 1000
means that coordinates are stored to 1/1000 nanometer accuracy.  XTC
files are portable binary files written in the NFS XDR data format, 
so that any machine which supports XDR should be able to read them. 
The number of atoms per snapshot cannot change with the <I>xtc</I> style.
The <I>unwrap</I> option of the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command allows
XTC coordinates to be written "unwrapped" by the image flags for each
atom.  Unwrapped means that if the atom has passed thru a periodic
boundary one or more times, the value is printed for what the
coordinate would be if it had not been wrapped back into the periodic
box.  Note that these coordinates may thus be far outside the box size
stored with the snapshot.
</P>
<P>The <I>xyz</I> style writes XYZ files, which is a simple text-based
coordinate format that many codes can read.
</P>
<P>Note that DCD, XTC, and XYZ formatted files can be read directly by
<A HREF = "http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd">VMD</A> (a popular molecular viewing
program).  See <A HREF = "Section_tools.html#vmd">Section tools</A> of the manual
and the tools/lmp2vmd/README.txt file for more information about
support in VMD for reading and visualizing LAMMPS dump files.
</P>
<P>The <I>mesh/stl</I> style dumps active STL geometries defined via 
<A HREF = "fix_mesh.html">fix mesh</A> commands into the specified file. 
If you do not supply the optional list of mesh IDs, all meshes are dumped, 
irrespective of whether they are used in a <A HREF = "fix_wall_gran.html">fix wall/gran</A>
command or not. By specifying a list of mesh IDs you can explicitly 
choose which meshes to dump. The group-ID is ignored, because the command 
is not applied to particles, but to mesh geometries. 
With keywords 'local', 'owned' or 'ghost' you can decide which parts
of the parallel meshes you want to dump (default is 'local'). If the
multiprocessor option is not used (no '%' in filename), data is gathered
from all processors, so using the default will output the whole mesh
data across all processors.
</P>
<P>Examples: 
</P>
<PRE>dump stl1 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump*.stl 
dump stl2 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump_proc%_local*.stl local
dump stl3 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump_proc%_ghost*.stl ghost
dump stl4 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump_proc_all_ghost*.stl ghost 
</PRE>
<P>The first command will write one file per time-step containing the complete 
mesh. The second command will output one file per time-step per processor
containing the local (owned) mesh elements of each processor. 
The third command will output one file per time-step per processor
containing the ghost (corona) mesh elements of each processor. 
The third command will output one file per time-step containing the 
ghost (corona) mesh elements of all processors. 
</P>
<P>With the <I>region</I> keyword, just those mesh element where the element center
(arithmetic average of all nodes) is in the specified region, will be
dumped.
</P>
<P>This dump is especially useful if a
<A HREF = "fix_move_mesh.html">fix move/mesh</A> is registered. If the position 
of the mesh is changed over time and you want to dump one file for each dump 
timestep for post-processing together with the particle data, you should use 
a filename like 'mydumpfile*.stl'. Note: This series of files can then be 
post-processed together with the particle dump file converted to VTK in 
Paraview , www.paraview.org
</P>
<P>By providing any ID (or a list of IDs) of <A HREF = "fix_mesh_surface.html">fix mesh/surface</A>
commands, you can specify which meshes to dump. If no meshes are specified,
all meshes used in the simulation are dumped.
</P>
<P>The <I>mesh/vtk</I> style can be used to dump active mesh geometries 
defined via <A HREF = "fix_mesh.html">fix mesh</A> commands to a series of VTK files. 
Different keywords can be used to dump the per-triangle stress, id, 
velocity, wear, stress components, area or the process which owns the element
(visulatisation of the parallel decomposition) into the specified file using a 
VTK file format. The list of mesh IDs is optional. As with the stl style, 
all active meshes are dumped if you do not supply the optional list of 
mesh IDs. By specifying list of mesh IDs you can explicitly choose 
which meshes to dump. The group-ID is ignored. Again, a series of files 
can be post-processed in Paraview , www.paraview.org
Most keywords as used for the <I>mesh/vtk</I> style are self-explanatory. 
Keyword <I>output</I> controlls if the data is written in a per-face manner
or as interpolated values to VTK. Keywords <I>aedges</I> and <I>acorners</I> dump
the number of active edges/corners per face. Keyword <I>nneighs</I> dumps the 
number of face neighbors LIGGGHTS has recognized for each face.
</P>
<P>By providing any ID (or a list of IDs) of <A HREF = "fix_mesh_surface.html">fix mesh/surface</A>
commands, you can specify which meshes to dump. If no meshes are specified,
all meshes used in the simulation are dumped.
</P>
<P>The <I>euler/vtk</I> style dumps the output of a <A HREF = "fix_ave_euler.html">fix ave/euler</A>
command into a series of VTK files. No further args are expected.
</P>
<P>The <I>decomposition/vtk</I> style dumps the processor grid decomposition
into a series of VTK files. No further args are expected.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including
timestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if the
minimization converges.  Note that this means a dump will not be
performed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked,
if the current timestep is not a multiple of N.  This behavior can be
changed via the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify first</A> command, which
can be useful if the dump command is invoked after a minimization
ended on an arbitrary timestep.  N can be changed between runs by
using the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify every</A> command (not allowed
for <I>dcd</I> style).
</P>
<P>The specified filename determines how the dump file(s) is written.
The default is to write one large text file, which is opened when the
dump command is invoked and closed when an <A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A>
command is used or when LAMMPS exits.  For the <I>dcd</I> and <I>xtc</I> styles,
this is a single large binary file.
</P>
<P>Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, tmp.dump.* becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.10000,
tmp.dump.20000, etc.  This option is not available for the <I>dcd</I> and
<I>xtc</I> styles.  Note that the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify pad</A>
command can be used to insure all timestep numbers are the same length
(e.g. 00010), which can make it easier to read a series of dump files
in order by some post-processing tools.
</P>
<P>If a "%" character appears in the filename, then one file is written
for each processor and the "%" character is replaced with the
processor ID from 0 to P-1.  For example, tmp.dump.% becomes
tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1, ... tmp.dump.P-1, etc.  This creates smaller
files and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines that
support parallel I/O for output. This option is not available for the
<I>dcd</I>, <I>xtc</I>, and <I>xyz</I> styles.
</P>
<P>Note that the "*" and "%" characters can be used together to produce a
large number of small dump files!
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".bin", the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file
will be about the same size as a text version, but will typically
write out much faster.  Of course, when post-processing, you will need
to convert it back to text format (see the <A HREF = "Section_tools.html#binary">binary2txt
tool</A>) or write your own code to read the
binary file.  The format of the binary file can be understood by
looking at the tools/binary2txt.cpp file.  This option is only
available for the <I>atom</I> and <I>custom</I> styles.
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".gz", the dump file (or files, if "*" or "%"
is also used) is written in gzipped format.  A gzipped dump file will
be about 3x smaller than the text version, but will also take longer
to write.  This option is not available for the <I>dcd</I> and <I>xtc</I>
styles.
</P>
<HR>

<P>This section explains the local attributes that can be specified as
part of the <I>local</I> style.
</P>
<P>The <I>index</I> attribute can be used to generate an index number from 1
to N for each line written into the dump file, where N is the total
number of local datums from all processors, or lines of output that
will appear in the snapshot.  Note that because data from different
processors depend on what atoms they currently own, and atoms migrate
between processor, there is no guarantee that the same index will be
used for the same info (e.g. a particular bond) in successive
snapshots.
</P>
<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow local vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details.  There are computes for
calculating local information such as indices, types, and energies for
bonds and angles.
</P>
<P>Note that computes which calculate global or per-atom quantities, as
opposed to local quantities, cannot be output in a dump local command.
Instead, global quantities can be output by the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A> command, and per-atom quantities can be
output by the dump custom command.
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the local vector calculated by
the compute is printed.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length local
array calculated by the compute.
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow local vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> to be output.  The ID in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been defined
previously in the input script.
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the local vector calculated by
the fix is printed.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length local
array calculated by the fix.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of how to dump bond info for a system,
including the distance and energy of each bond:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all property/local batom1 batom2 btype 
compute 2 all bond/local dist eng
dump 1 all local 1000 tmp.dump index c_1<B>1</B> c_1<B>2</B> c_1<B>3</B> c_2<B>1</B> c_2<B>2</B> 
</PRE>

<P>This section explains the atom attributes that can be specified as
part of the <I>custom</I> and <I>cfg</I> styles.

<P>The <I>id</I>, <I>mol</I>, <I>type</I>, <I>element</I>, <I>mass</I>, <I>vx</I>, <I>vy</I>, <I>vz</I>, <I>fx</I>, <I>fy</I>,
<I>fz</I>, <I>q</I> attributes are self-explanatory.
</P>
<P><I>Id</I> is the atom ID.  <I>Mol</I> is the molecule ID, included in the data
file for molecular systems.  <I>Type</I> is the atom type.  <I>Element</I> is
typically the chemical name of an element, which you must assign to
each type via the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify element</A> command.
More generally, it can be any string you wish to associated with an
atom type.  <I>Mass</I> is the atom mass.  <I>Vx</I>, <I>vy</I>, <I>vz</I>, <I>fx</I>, <I>fy</I>,
<I>fz</I>, and <I>q</I> are components of atom velocity and force and atomic
charge.
</P>
<P>There are several options for outputting atom coordinates.  The <I>x</I>,
<I>y</I>, <I>z</I> attributes write atom coordinates "unscaled", in the
appropriate distance <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> (Angstroms, sigma, etc).  Use
<I>xs</I>, <I>ys</I>, <I>zs</I> if you want the coordinates "scaled" to the box size,
so that each value is 0.0 to 1.0.  If the simulation box is triclinic
(tilted), then all atom coords will still be between 0.0 and 1.0.  Use
<I>xu</I>, <I>yu</I>, <I>zu</I> if you want the coordinates "unwrapped" by the image
flags for each atom.  Unwrapped means that if the atom has passed thru
a periodic boundary one or more times, the value is printed for what
the coordinate would be if it had not been wrapped back into the
periodic box.  Note that using <I>xu</I>, <I>yu</I>, <I>zu</I> means that the
coordinate values may be far outside the box bounds printed with the
snapshot.  Using <I>xsu</I>, <I>ysu</I>, <I>zsu</I> is similar to using <I>xu</I>, <I>yu</I>, <I>zu</I>,
except that the unwrapped coordinates are scaled by the box size. Atoms
that have passed through a periodic boundary will have the corresponding
cooordinate increased or decreased by 1.0.
</P>
<P>The image flags can be printed directly using the <I>ix</I>,
<I>iy</I>, <I>iz</I> attributes. The <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command
describes in more detail what is meant by scaled vs unscaled
coordinates and the image flags.
</P>
<P>The <I>mux</I>, <I>muy</I>, <I>muz</I> attributes are specific to dipolar systems
defined with an atom style of <I>dipole</I>.  They give the orientation of
the atom's point dipole moment.  The <I>mu</I> attribute gives the
magnitude of the atom's dipole moment.
</P>
<P>The <I>radius</I> and <I>diameter</I> attributes are specific to extended
spherical particles that have a finite size, such as those defined
with an atom style of <I>sphere</I>.
</P>
<P>The <I>omegax</I>, <I>omegay</I>, and <I>omegaz</I> attributes are specific to
extended spherical or aspherical particles that have an angular
velocity.  Only certain atom styles, such as <I>sphere</I> define this
quantity.
</P>
<P>The <I>angmomx</I>, <I>angmomy</I>, and <I>angmomz</I> attributes are specific to
extended aspherical particles that have an angular momentum.  Only
the <I>ellipsoid</I> atom style defines this quantity.
</P>
<P>The <I>tqx</I>, <I>tqy</I>, <I>tqz</I> attributes are for extended spherical or
aspherical particles that can sustain a rotational torque due
to interactions with other particles.
</P>
<P>The <I>spin</I>, <I>eradius</I>, <I>ervel</I>, and <I>erforce</I> attributes are for
particles that represent nuclei and electrons modeled with the
electronic force field (EFF).  See <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style
electron</A> and <A HREF = "pair_eff.html">pair_style eff</A> for more
details.
</P>
<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-atom vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details.  There are computes for
calculating the per-atom energy, stress, centro-symmetry parameter,
and coordination number of individual atoms.
</P>
<P>Note that computes which calculate global or local quantities, as
opposed to per-atom quantities, cannot be output in a dump custom
command.  Instead, global quantities can be output by the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command, and local quantities
can be output by the dump local command.
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the compute is printed.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in
the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the compute.
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow vector or array per-atom
quantities calculated by a <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been
defined previously in the input script.  The <A HREF = "fix_ave_atom.html">fix
ave/atom</A> command is one that calculates per-atom
quantities.  Since it can time-average per-atom quantities produced by
any <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A>, <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A>, or atom-style
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>, this allows those time-averaged results to
be written to a dump file.
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the fix is printed.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the fix.
</P>
<P>The <I>v_name</I> attribute allows per-atom vectors calculated by a
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> to be output.  The name in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that has been
defined previously in the input script.  Only an atom-style variable
can be referenced, since it is the only style that generates per-atom
values.  Variables of style <I>atom</I> can reference individual atom
attributes, per-atom atom attributes, thermodynamic keywords, or
invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so
this is a very general means of creating quantities to output to a
dump file.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">Section_modify</A> of the manual for information
on how to add new compute and fix styles to LAMMPS to calculate
per-atom quantities which could then be output into dump files.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>To write gzipped dump files, you must compile LAMMPS with the
-DLAMMPS_GZIP option - see the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_2">Making
LAMMPS</A> section of the documentation.
</P>
<P>To be able to use <I>atom/vtk</I>, you have to link to VTK libraries.
</P>
<P>The <I>xtc</I> style is part of the XTC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.  This is
because some machines may not support the low-level XDR data format
that XTC files are written with, which will result in a compile-time
error when a low-level include file is not found.  Putting this style
in a package makes it easy to exclude from a LAMMPS build for those
machines.  However, the XTC package also includes two compatibility
header files and associated functions, which should be a suitable
substitute on machines that do not have the appropriate native header
files.  This option can be invoked at build time by adding
-DLAMMPS_XDR to the CCFLAGS variable in the appropriate low-level
Makefile, e.g. src/MAKE/Makefile.foo.  This compatibility mode has
been tested successfully on Cray XT3/XT4/XT5 and IBM BlueGene/L
machines and should also work on IBM BG/P, and Windows XP/Vista/7
machines.
