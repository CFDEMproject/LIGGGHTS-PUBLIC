<P><B>LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:</B>
</P>
<P>This LIGGGHTS command offers the following improvements vs. LAMMPS: The stiffness and damping coefficients k_n, k_t, gamma_n, gamma_t are now derived from the material properties. Also, a new model for macroscopic cohesion is introduced.
</P>
<P><B>General description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>gran</I> styles use the following formula for the frictional force between two granular particles, when the distance r between two particles of radii Ri and Rj is less than their contact distance d = Ri + Rj. There is no force between the particles when r > d: 
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_gran_html_60b8ced2.png">
</CENTER>
<P>In the first term is the normal force between the two particles and the second term is the 
tangential force. The normal force has 2 terms, a contact force and a damping force. The 
tangential force also has 2 terms: a shear force and a damping force. The shear force is 
a "history" effect that accounts for the tangential displacement ("tangential overlap") 
between the particles for the duration of the time they are in contact. This term is 
included in pair styles <I>hooke/history</I> and <I>hertz/history</I>, but is not included in 
pair style <I>hooke</I>. Keyword <I>tangential_damping</I> can be used to eliminate the second
part of the force in tangential direction. Additional keywords control model settings such as 
<I>rolling_friction</I> and <I>cohesion</I>.
</P>
<P>The quantities in the equations are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>delta_n = d - r = overlap distance of 2 particles  

<LI>k_n = elastic constant for normal contact 

<LI>k_t = elastic constant for tangential contact 

<LI>gamma_n = viscoelastic damping constant for normal contact 

<LI>gamma_t = viscoelastic damping constant for tangential contact 

<LI>delta_t = tangential displacement vector between 2 spherical particles which is truncated to satisfy a frictional yield criterion 

<LI>rmu = coefficient of rolling friction 

<LI>contactradius = contact radius, equal to particle radius - 0.5 * delta_n 

<LI>v_n = normal component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles 

<LI>v_t = tangential component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles 

<LI>w_r = relative rotational velocity of the 2 particles

<H3>General comments, cohesion model, rolling friction model 
</H3>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to use atom styles beginning from 1, e.g. 1,2,3,...
</P>
<P>For all pair styles, the coefficient of friction cof is the upper limit of the tangential force through 
the Coulomb criterion Ft = cof *Fn, where Ft and Fn are the total tangential and normal force components 
in the formulas above. Thus in the Hookean case, the tangential force between 2 particles grows according 
to a tangential spring and dash-pot model until Ft/Fn = cof and is then held at Ft = Fn*cof until the 
particles lose contact. In the Hertzian case, a similar analogy holds, though the spring is no longer linear.
</P>
<P>The optional <B>rolling friction model</B> (a constant directional torque model, see Ai et al) is activated via
<I>rolling_friction</I> = 'cdt', and adds an additional torque contribution, equal to
</P>
<P>torque_rf = rmu*k_n*delta_n*w_r_shear/mag(w_r_shear)*(R*).
</P>
<P>w_r_shear is the projection of w_r into the shear plane, where w_r = w1-w2
</P>
<P>If the rolling friction model is activated, the coefficient of rolling friction (rmu) must be defined as
</P>
<PRE>fix id all property/global coefficientRollingFriction peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the coefficient of rolling friction between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) 
</PRE>
<P>A simple linear <B>cohesion model</B> can be activated by setting <I>cohesion</I> = 'sjkr' 
(simplified Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model). If two particle are in contact, 
it adds an additional normal force tending to maintain the contact, which writes 
</P>
<P>F = k A, 
</P>
<P>where A is the particle contact area and k is the cohesion energy density in J/m3. If you are 
using the linear cohesion model, you must also define the cohesion energy density:
</P>
<PRE>fix id all property/global cohesionEnergyDensity peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. .
    (value_ij=value for the cohesion energy density (in Energy/Length3 units) between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) 
</PRE>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The cohesion model has been derived for the Hertzian Style, it may note be 
appropriate for the Hookean styles.
</P>
<P>For granular styles there are no additional coefficients to set for each pair of atom types 
via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command. All settings are global and are made via the 
pair_style command. However you must still use the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> for all pairs 
of granular atom types. For example the command
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff * * 
</PRE>
<P>should be used if all atoms in the simulation interact via a granular potential 
(i.e. one of the pair styles above is used). If a granular potential is used as a sub-style 
of <A HREF = "pair_hybrid.html">pair_style hybrid</A>, then specific atom types can be used in the pair_coeff 
command to determine which atoms interact via a granular potential. 
</P>
<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info:</B>
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> mix, shift, table, and tail options are not 
relevant for granular pair styles.
</P>
<P>These pair styles write their information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart files</A>, 
so a pair_style command does not need to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The material properties are not written to restart files! Thus, if you 
restart a simulation, you have to re-define them (by using the fixes mentioned above).
</P>
<P>These pair styles can only be used via the pair keyword of the <A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> 
command. They do not support the inner, middle, outer keywords. 
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>These pair styles require that atoms store torque and angular velocity (omega) as defined by the <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style</A>. They also require a per-particle radius is stored. The <I>granular</I> atom style does all of this.
</P>
<P>This pair style requires you to use the <A HREF = "communicate.html">communicate vel yes</A> option so that velocites are stored by ghost atoms.
</P>
<P>Only unit system that are self-consistent (si, cgs, lj) can be used with this pair style.
