<H3>fix particledistribution/discrete command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID particledistribution/discrete seed ntemp t_id t_m ...  
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>particledistribution/discrete = style name of this fix command  

<LI>seed = random number generator seed (integer value) 

<LI>ntemp = number of particle templates to be used in this command 

<LI>zero or more <I>t_id</I>/<I>t_m</I> pairs are appended, number of pairs must match ntemp 

<PRE><I>t_id</I> = id of a fix of type particletemplate/sphere
<I>t_m</I> = mass % for this template in the distribution 
</PRE>

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a discrete particle distribution that defines a discrete particle distribution to be inserted by the <A HREF = "fix_pour_dev.html">fix_pour_dev</A> command. It takes several templates of type <A HREF = "fix_particletemplate_sphere.html">fix_particletemplate_sphere</A> as inputs, which define the properties of the single particles that are part of the distribution.
</P>
<P>At insertion, particles are chosen according to the mass-% distribution as defined by each pair (t_id, t_m). Note that the sum of all weights t_m must be equal to 1.0, if this is not the case the user is warned at the distribution is normalized. Note that large particles are inserted first, so that a higher volume fraction can be achieved. If not all desired insertions could be performed, it is likely that the distribution is not accurately reproduced.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: As opposed to the number-based distributions used by <A HREF = "fix_pour.html">fix_pour</A> and <A HREF = "fix_pour_legacy.html">fix_pour_legacy</A>, this fix uses the more common distribution based on mass-% as input (as does <A HREF = "">fix_particletemplate_sphere</A>).
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>Information about the random state in this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart files</A> so you can restart a simulation with the same particles being chosen for insertion. None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options are relevant to this fix. No global scalar or vector or per-atom quantities are stored by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output commands</A>. No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start</I>/<I>stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command. This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
